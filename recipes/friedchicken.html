      <p class="text">
        Nothing says 'south' like good fried chicken, but when pecan honey glaze
        is drizzled on top then it takes it to a whole new level.
        I was inspired when my husband and I visited a soul food restaurant, and I just had to
        come home and duplicate it. I must admit I think I hit the nail on the
        head - at least my family admits it. Enjoy!

        <li class="grocery-items">1 whole whole chicken, cut into 8 pieces</li>
        <li class="grocery-items">1 teaspoon seasoned salt, or to taste</li>
        <li class="grocery-items">2 eggs, beaten</li>
        <li class="grocery-items">2 cups self-rising flour</li>
        <li class="grocery-items">1 pinch salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
        <li class="grocery-items">1 cup butter</li>
        <li class="grocery-items">Â½ cup honey</li>
        <li class="grocery-items">1 cup chopped pecans</li>

      <h3 class="header">Directions</h3>
      <ol class="list">
        <li class="grocery-items">Heat peanut oil in deep skillet or deep-fryer to 375 degrees F (190degrees C). 
Oil should be deep enough to cover chicken pieces halfway.
        </li class="grocery-items">
        <li class="grocery-items">Season chicken pieces on all sides with seasoned salt.</li>
        <li class="grocery-items">Put beaten eggs in a large bowl. Mix flour, salt, and black pepper in a large paper bag.
        </li>
        <li class="grocery-items">Dip seasoned chicken into beaten egg; 
place each piece into bag containing seasoned flour and shake to coat.
        </li>
        <li class="grocery-items"> Cook chicken in hot oil until no longer pink at the bone and the juices run clear, about 10 minutes per side. 
  An instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the thigh near the bone should read 165 degrees F (75 degrees C).
  Transfer chicken to a plate lined with paper towels to drain.
        </li>
        <li class="grocery-items">Melt butter in saucepan over medium heat. Whisk honey into melted butter; 
cook, whisking occasionally, until bubbles start to form, about 5 minutes. 
Reduce heat to low; simmer another 10 minutes. 
Fold pecans into butter mixture; cook until the pecans are hot, 2 to 3 minutes. 
Drizzle over hot chicken pieces to serve.
