    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Nothing says 'south' like good fried chicken, but when pecan honey glaze is drizzled on top then it takes it to a whole new level. 
        I was inspired when my husband and I visited a soul food restaurant, and I just had to come home and duplicate it. 
        I must admit I think I hit the nail on the head - at least my family admits it. Enjoy!

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 quart peanut oil for frying, or as needed</li>
        <li>1 whole whole chicken, cut into 8 pieces</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon seasoned salt, or to taste</li>
        <li>2 eggs, beaten</li>
        <li>2 cups self-rising flour</li>
        <li>1 pinch salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>1 cup butter</li>
        <li>Â½ cup honey</li>
        <li>1 cup chopped pecans</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat peanut oil in deep skillet or deep-fryer to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). 
            Oil should be deep enough to cover chicken pieces halfway.</li>
        <li>Season chicken pieces on all sides with seasoned salt.</li>
        <li>Put beaten eggs in a large bowl. Mix flour, salt, and black pepper in a large paper bag.</li>
        <li>Dip seasoned chicken into beaten egg; place each piece into bag containing seasoned flour and shake to coat.</li>
        <li>Cook chicken in hot oil until no longer pink at the bone and the juices run clear, about 10 minutes per side. 
            An instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the thigh near the bone should read 165 degrees F (75 degrees C). 
            Transfer chicken to a plate lined with paper towels to drain.</li>
        <li>Melt butter in saucepan over medium heat. Whisk honey into melted butter; cook, whisking occasionally, until bubbles start to form, about 5 minutes. 
            Reduce heat to low; simmer another 10 minutes. Fold pecans into butter mixture; cook until the pecans are hot, 2 to 3 minutes. 
            Drizzle over hot chicken pieces to serve.</li>
    </ol>
