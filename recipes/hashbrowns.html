        Believe it or not, making crispy hash browns is actually quite easy.
        First, shred your potatoes using your preferred method — either with a
        grater, food processor, or mandolin's. Rinse the potatoes until the
        water is clear, then drain and squeeze out all the remaining liquid
        (this will ensure the hash browns are extra crispy).
      </p>
      <p class="text">
        Next, you'll add in your binding agents (flour and egg) as well as any
        other ingredients or seasonings. This recipe only calls for onion, but
        you could also add cheese, cayenne pepper, or garlic to the mixture.
      </p>
      <p class="text">
        Form your hash browns into patties (either one large hash brown or
        multiple smaller pancake-like hash browns) and pan fry them in oil,
        about five minutes on each side.

          Rinse shredded potatoes until water is clear, then drain and squeeze
          dry.

        <li class="grocery-items">
          Place shreds in a bowl and mix in the onion, flour, and egg until
          evenly distributed.

        <li class="grocery-items">
          Heat about 1/4 inch of oil in a large heavy skillet over medium-high
          heat. When oil is sizzling hot, place potatoes into the pan in a 1/2
          inch thick layer. Cover the whole bottom of the pan, or make separate
          piles like pancakes.
        </li>
        <li class="grocery-items">
          Cook until nicely browned on the bottom, then flip over and brown on
          the other side. It should take at least 5 minutes per side. If you are
          cooking them in one big piece, it can be cut into quarters for easier
          flipping.
        </li>
        <li class="grocery-items">
          Remove from pan, and drain on paper towels. Season with salt and
          pepper and serve immediately.
